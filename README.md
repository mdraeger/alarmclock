# Alarmclock application

## Purpose

This little application resembles a very simple alarm clock that uses the omxplayer as backend. 

It is intended to run on my daughter's Raspberry Pi which is embedded in her LEGO Friends motor yacht.

## Design

The design was created with Qt designer, the analog clock widget is hand written, taken from [here!](http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/centos0/ics-custom-build/BUILD/PyQt-x11-gpl-4.7.2/examples/designer/plugins/widgets/analogclock.py)
